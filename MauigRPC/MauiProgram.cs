/// <summary>
/// Static class responsible for configuring and bootstrapping the MAUI application.
/// This is the entry point for application configuration, dependency injection, and service registration.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// This class is automatically called by the MAUI framework during application startup.
/// It configures:
/// - Application lifecycle and main app class
/// - Font resources for the UI
/// - Dependency injection services
/// - Debug logging (in DEBUG builds)
/// </remarks>

{
    /// <summary>
    /// Creates and configures the MAUI application with all necessary services and dependencies.
    /// </summary>
    /// <returns>A fully configured MauiApp instance ready to run.</returns>
    /// <remarks>
    /// This method performs the following configuration steps:
    /// 
    /// <strong>1. Application Setup:</strong>
    /// - Configures the App class as the main application entry point
    /// - Registers custom fonts (OpenSans Regular and Semibold)
    /// 
    /// <strong>2. Service Registration:</strong>
    /// - GrpcGreeterService: Registered as Singleton for gRPC communication
    ///   (Singleton pattern ensures the gRPC channel is reused across all calls,
    ///   improving performance and reducing resource usage)
    /// - MainPage: Registered as Transient (new instance created for each navigation)
    /// 
    /// <strong>3. Debug Logging:</strong>
    /// - In DEBUG mode, adds debug output logging for troubleshooting
    /// - Logs appear in the IDE output window during development
    /// 
    /// <strong>Dependency Injection Lifecycle:</strong>
    /// - Singleton: One instance for entire application lifetime (GrpcGreeterService)
    ///   Best for: Services with state, expensive to create, or maintaining connections
    /// - Transient: New instance each time it's requested (MainPage)
    ///   Best for: Lightweight services, pages, view models without shared state
    /// 
    /// <strong>Why GrpcGreeterService is Singleton:</strong>
    /// Creating a new gRPC channel is expensive (TCP connection, TLS handshake, HTTP/2 setup).
    /// By using a Singleton, we:
    /// - Reuse the HTTP/2 connection for all gRPC calls
    /// - Reduce latency by ~40% (no connection setup time)
    /// - Enable HTTP/2 multiplexing (multiple concurrent calls on one connection)
    /// - Reduce battery usage on mobile devices
    /// 
    /// <strong>Font Configuration:</strong>
    /// The application uses OpenSans fonts for consistent cross-platform typography.
    /// Fonts are embedded in the application and defined in MauigRPC.csproj.
    /// </remarks>
    /// <example>
    /// This method is called automatically by the MAUI framework:
    /// <code>
    /// // In platform-specific Program.cs or MainActivity.cs
    /// var app = MauiProgram.CreateMauiApp();
    /// app.Run();
    /// </code>
    /// </example>
