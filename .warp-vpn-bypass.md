# Surfshark VPN Bypass for Warp

## Quick Fix for Connection Issues

If you're experiencing connection issues with Warp while using Surfshark VPN, add Warp to the VPN bypass list.

## Setup Steps

### 1. Open Surfshark Settings
- Click Surfshark icon in menu bar (top-right)
- Select "Settings" or "Preferences"

### 2. Enable Bypasser
- Navigate to: **Settings → VPN Settings → Bypasser**
- Toggle **Bypasser ON**

### 3. Add Warp to Bypass

**Option A - Bypass Application (Easiest):**
```
1. Click "Add application to Bypasser"
2. Browse to: /Applications/Warp.app
3. Select and confirm
```

**Option B - Bypass Domains:**
Add these domains to bypass list:
```
warp.dev
*.warp.dev
anthropic.com
*.anthropic.com
claude.ai
*.claude.ai
```

**Option C - Bypass IP Address:**
```
34.49.216.32/32
```

### 4. Save and Reconnect
- Click "Save" or "Apply"
- Disconnect and reconnect Surfshark VPN
- Restart Warp terminal

## Verification

Test if bypass is working:

```bash
# Check connection to Warp
curl -I https://warp.dev

# Check your current IP (should be VPN IP)
curl https://ifconfig.me

# Warp should work despite VPN being active
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Bypasser not working
**Solution**: Try "Inverse Mode" - bypass everything EXCEPT certain apps
- Enable Inverse Bypasser mode
- Add other applications (browsers, etc.)
- Leave Warp OUT of the list

### Issue: Still connection issues
**Solution 1**: Temporarily disable VPN
```bash
# Quit Surfshark
killall Surfshark
```

**Solution 2**: Change Surfshark protocol
- Settings → VPN Settings → Protocol
- Try switching between:
  - WireGuard (fastest)
  - IKEv2
  - OpenVPN (UDP/TCP)

### Issue: Can't find Bypasser in settings
**Solution**: Update Surfshark to latest version
```bash
# Check for updates
# Open Surfshark → About → Check for updates
```

## Alternative: Use Different VPN Location

Some VPN servers may have better routing to Anthropic/Warp servers:

**Recommended locations:**
- United States (East Coast)
- Netherlands
- United Kingdom
- Singapore

## macOS Network Settings (Advanced)

If issues persist, check macOS network order:

```bash
# List network services
networksetup -listallnetworkservices

# Make sure Warp can bypass VPN at system level
# System Preferences → Network → Set Service Order
# Ensure Wi-Fi is above VPN
```

## Notes

- Bypasser only works when Surfshark is connected
- Changes take effect immediately (no restart needed)
- Warp will use your real IP when bypassed (normal behavior)
- VPN protection still active for all other applications

## Quick Commands

```bash
# Test Warp connectivity
curl -s https://warp.dev -w "Time: %{time_total}s\n"

# Check if using VPN
curl https://ifconfig.me

# Test DNS resolution
dig warp.dev

# Restart Warp (if needed)
# Cmd+Q to quit, then reopen
```

## Summary

**What to add to Surfshark Bypasser:**
1. ✅ Application: `/Applications/Warp.app`
2. ✅ Domains: `warp.dev`, `anthropic.com`
3. ✅ IP (optional): `34.49.216.32`

This ensures Warp can connect to Anthropic servers while keeping your other traffic protected by VPN.
